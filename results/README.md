# Results

Store outputs of simulations, synthesis and on-board captures here.

Suggested layout:
- `simulation/waveforms/` — .vcd/.wdb files, png snapshots
- `simulation/test_outputs/` — logs with passed/failed
- `synthesis/resource_utilization.txt`
- `synthesis/timing_summary.txt`
- `on_board/` — ILA captures, photos, notes

When adding files, name them with date and module (e.g., `2025-09-12_uart_rx_wave.vcd`)
