# Project Report — Draft

I shall utilise this file to build my final lab report incrementally.

## Suggested report structure
1. Title page (course, name, date)
2. Abstract (short summary)
3. Introduction and motivation
4. System architecture and block diagram
5. Module design (separate sub-sections)
   - UART
   - FIFO
   - Huffman encoder
   - Viterbi encoder
   - QAM modulator
6. Test strategy and verification results
7. Synthesis results, resource utilization, timing
8. On-board testing and captured waveforms
9. Challenges and improvements
10. Conclusion and future work
11. References & appendices
