# Project Overview

## Motivation
- Objective: build a compact baseband processor chain to demonstrate RTL design, verification and FPGA deployment.
- Educational goals: modular RTL design, testbench-driven development, synthesis constraints, on-board validation.

## Scope
- The project focuses on the digital baseband pipeline (no RF front-end).
- Emphasis on correctness, modularity, and documenting design choices for future reuse.

## Deliverables
- RTL sources under `/src`
- Testbenches under `/tb`
- Simulation & synthesis reports under `/results`
- Final lab report draft under `docs/Report_Draft.md`
